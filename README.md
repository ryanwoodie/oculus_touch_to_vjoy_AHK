# oculus_touch_to_voy_AHK
Autohotkey script that maps Oculus Touch buttons and thumbsticks to a bunch of Vjoy (virtual joystick) buttons, in addition to the controller hand movement pitch/roll/yaw being mapped to Vjoy joystick axes.

Presently the AHK script is for Left hand controller. I originally created it to be able to have more joystick controls/buttons available while using Condor Soaring Simulator in VR.  See the comments in the AHK script for more details on the mapping.

Prerequisites
The AHK script needs to be put in the same folder as these AHK scripts (https://github.com/rajetic/auto_oculus_touch) to work. The ZIP file in "releases" includes these AHK scripts as well
You must have AutoHotKey installed. It is available from https://autohotkey.com
You must have Vjoy installed. It is available from http://vjoystick.sourceforge.net/site/index.php/download-a-install
