# oculus_touch_to_voy_AHK
Autohotkey script that allows you to use Oculus Touch as a virtual joystick.

Presently the AHK script is for Left hand controller. I originally created it to be able to have more joystick controls/buttons available while using Condor Soaring Simulator in VR.

Prerequisites
The AHK script needs to be put in the same folder as these AHK scripts (https://github.com/rajetic/auto_oculus_touch) to work. The ZIP file in "releases" includes these AHK scripts as well
You must have AutoHotKey installed. It is available from https://autohotkey.com
You must have Vjoy installed. It is available from http://vjoystick.sourceforge.net/site/index.php/download-a-install
