# oculus_touch_to_voy_AHK
Autohotkey script that allows you to use Oculus Touch as a virtual joystick.

Current script is for Left hand controller. I originally created it to be able to have more joystick controls/buttons available while using Condor Soaring Simulator in VR.

The AHK script needs to be put in the same folder as these AHK scripts (https://github.com/rajetic/auto_oculus_touch) to work. Requires AHK program as well, of course.
